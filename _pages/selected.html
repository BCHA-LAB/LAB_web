      <p>Abstractâ€”Cloud-based training and edge-based inference
modes for Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT)
applications suffer from accuracy degradation due to physiological signal variations among patients. On-chip learning can
overcome this issue by online adaptation of neural network
parameters for user-specific tasks. However, existing on-chip
learning processors have limitations in terms of versatility,
resource utilization, and energy efficiency. We propose HybMED,
which is a novel neural signal processor that supports on-chip hybrid neural network training using a composite direct
feedback alignment-based paradigm. HybMED is suitable for
general-purpose health monitoring AIoMT devices. It improves
resource utilization and area efficiency by the reconfigurable</p>
