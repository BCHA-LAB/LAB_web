      <p>Abstract—Cloud-based training and edge-based inference
modes for Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT)
applications suffer from accuracy degradation due to physiological signal variations among patients. On-chip learning can
overcome this issue by online adaptation of neural network
parameters for user-specific tasks. However, existing on-chip
learning processors have limitations in terms of versatility,
resource utilization, and energy efficiency. We propose HybMED,
which is a novel neural signal processor that supports on-chip hybrid neural network training using a composite direct
feedback alignment-based paradigm. HybMED is suitable for
general-purpose health monitoring AIoMT devices. It improves
resource utilization and area efficiency by the reconfigurable
homogeneous core with heterogeneous data flow and enhances
energy efficiency by exploiting sparsity at different granularities.
The chip was fabricated by TSMC 40nm process and tested in
multiple physiological signal processing tasks, demonstrating an
average improvement in accuracy of 41.16% following online fewshot learning. The chip demonstrates an area efficiency of 1.17
GOPS/mm2
and an energy efficiency of 1.58 TOPS/W. Compared
to the previous state-of-the-art physiological signal processors
with on-chip learning, the chip achieves a 65× improvement
in area efficiency and 1.48× improvement in energy efficiency,
respectively.
